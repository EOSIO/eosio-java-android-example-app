The EOSIO SDK for Java: Android Example App is a simple application demonstrating how to integrate with EOSIO-based blockchains using [EOSIO SDK for Java](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java). The application does two things: fetches your account token balance and pushes a transfer action.

## Requirements

* Android SDK 6.0+
* Android Studio 3.0+
* JDK 1.7

## Installation

To get the example application up and running:

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-android-example-app.git`
1. Open the project with Android Studio.
1. Modify `eosio.properties` file:

    ```java
    node_url=[your node endpoint URL] //mandatory
    from_account=[your account name] //optional
    to_account=[receiver account] //optional
    from_account_private_key=[your private key] //optional
    amount=[amount to transfer] //optional; e.g., 1.1234 EOS
    memo=[transfer memo] //optional
    private_keys=[for multiple key tests in instrumentation test] //optional
    ```

    `from_account`, `to_account`, `from_account_private_key`, `amount`, `memo` and `private_keys` are optional convenience properties which will prefill the app's form. `node_url` is required.

1. Run the app.

## About the App

The app demonstrates how to:
- use the [Java RPC Provider implementation](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-rpc-provider) to query the chain for an account's token balance,
- get a new transaction from [`TransactionSession`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/session/TransactionSession.java),
- create an action and add it to a transaction,
- and sign and broadcast the transaction.

To do this we are using a few libraries and providers, in concert:

* [EOSIO SDK for Java](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java): The core EOSIO SDK for Java library
* [Java RPC Provider](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-rpc-provider): An RPC provider implementation for Java (including Android)
* [ABIEOS Serialization Provider for Android](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-android-abieos-serialization-provider): A pluggable serialization provider for EOSIO SDK for Java using ABIEOS (for transaction and action conversion between JSON and binary data representations)
* [Softkey Signature Provider](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-softkey-signature-provider): An example pluggable signature provider for EOSIO SDK for Java for signing transactions using in-memory keys (not for production use)

**WARNING**: [Android 9 disables clear text traffic support by default](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config#CleartextTrafficPermitted) so `android:usesCleartextTraffic` setting in [AndroidManifest.xml](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-android-example-app/blob/master/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) is used to enable/disable the support depending on the build variant you use. 

## How to Transact

[`TransactionTask.java`](app/src/main/java/one/block/androidexampleapp/TransactionTask.java) contains basic sample code for constructing, signing and broadcasting transactions using the `eosiojava` libraries.

### Set Up Your TransactionSession

First, set up your [`TransactionSession`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/session/TransactionSession.java). This is your factory for creating new transactions:

1. Create an instance of the [`AbiEosSerializationProviderImpl`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-android-abieos-serialization-provider/blob/develop/eosiojavaabieos/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojavaabieosserializationprovider/AbiEosSerializationProviderImpl.java) serialization provider from the [`eosiojavaandroidabieosserializationprovider`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-android-abieos-serialization-provider) library.
1. Create an instance of the [`EosioJavaRpcProviderImpl`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-rpc-provider/blob/master/eosiojavarpcprovider/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojavarpcprovider/implementations/EosioJavaRpcProviderImpl.java) RPC provider with an input string pointing to a nodeos RPC endpoint. You can also use `EosioJavaRpcProviderImpl(String, Boolean)` constructor to enable network debug log.
1. Create an instance of the [`ABIProviderImpl`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/implementations/ABIProviderImpl.java) ABI provider, instantiating it with the RPC and serialization provider instances.
1. Create an instance of the [` SoftKeySignatureProviderImpl`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java-softkey-signature-provider/blob/master/eosiojavasoftkeysignatureprovider/src/main/java/one/block/eosiosoftkeysignatureprovider/SoftKeySignatureProviderImpl.java) signature provider. (This particular implementation is not recommended for production use due to its simplistic management of private keys).
    - Import an EOS private key associated with the sender's account.
1. Create an instance of [`TransactionSession`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/session/TransactionSession.java), which is used for spawning [`TransactionProcessor`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/session/TransactionProcessor.java)s.

### Create, Sign and Broadcast Transactions

Now you're ready to create transactions using your `TransactionSession`:

1. Create an instance of [`TransactionProcessor`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/session/TransactionProcessor.java) from the [`TransactionSession`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/session/TransactionSession.java) instance above by calling ` TransactionSession#getTransactionProcessor()` or `TransactionSession#getTransactionProcessor(Transaction)`.
1. Call `TransactionProcessor#prepare(List)` with a list of Actions. The method will serialize the actions, which can always be queried with `Transaction#getActions()`. The transaction now is ready to be signed and broadcast.
1. Call `TransactionProcessor#signAndBroadcast()` to sign the transaction inside [`TransactionProcessor`](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/blob/master/eosiojava/src/main/java/one/block/eosiojava/session/TransactionProcessor.java) and broadcast it.
